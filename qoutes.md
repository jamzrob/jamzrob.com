> Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never-in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. - [Wiston Churchill](https://www.nationalchurchillmuseum.org/sir-winston-churchill-biography.html)

> All my future seemed to hinge on that day; and I often tremble when I ask myself the question ‘what if I had not gotten a job'. - [John D Rockefeller](https://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303/ref=asc_df_1400077303/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312021252609&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14141131775308424092&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9013184&hvtargid=pla-332442745144&psc=1)

> The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation, and go to the grave with the song still in them. - [Henry David Thoreau](https://www.amazon.com/Walden-Civil-Disobedience-Henry-Thoreau/dp/0451532163/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=walden&qid=1603828188&sr=8-3)

> No one was like him. Terrible were his crimes—
> but if you wish to blackguard the Great King,
> think how mean, obscure and dull you are,
> your labors lowly and your merits less . . . . [reference Alexander the Great](https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Great-Hunt-New-Past/dp/1585675652/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Alexander+the+Great%3A+The+Hunt+for+a+New+Past&qid=1603828326&s=books&sr=1-1)

> People get stuck as they get older. Our minds are sort of electrochemical computers. Your thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind. You are really etching chemical patterns. In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them. It’s a rare person who etches grooves that are other than a specific way of looking at things, a specific way of questioning things. It’s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing. Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they’re rare. [Steve Jobs](http://reprints.longform.org/playboy-interview-steve-jobs)

> Good design is as little as possible. Less, but better, because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity. [Dieter Rams](https://www.amazon.com/Weniger-aber-besser-Less-better/dp/3980348512)

> Uncurious people do not lead examined lives; they cannot see causes that lie deep than the surface [Yvon Chouinard](https://www.amazon.com/Let-People-Surfing-Education-Businessman/dp/0143037838)

> His ruling force was focus. Time existed for him not in some promising future of sentimental past but in the present condition, the intricate web of problems and solutions, imagination and code.
